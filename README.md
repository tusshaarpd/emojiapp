How It Works
Fetch Emoji Data: The app fetches all emoji data from the EmojiHub API when the app starts (or refreshes).
User Input: The user enters a reaction like "happy," "sad," or "hugging."
Find Matching Emoji: The app searches for an emoji whose name contains the user-provided text.
Display Emoji: If a matching emoji is found, it is displayed with its name, Unicode, and a large-sized emoji using the HTML code.
